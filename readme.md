# AI Integration Protocol (AIP)

The AI Integration Protocol (AIP) is a standardized approach for managing AI-generated integration mappings and maintaining a standard for exchanging schemas between systems.

## Key Features

- Central AI Integration Platform as a Service (AI IPASS)
- Standardized schema management
- AI-generated integration mappings
- Automated schema polling and RAG updates
- Vector store for efficient data retrieval
- Secure and compliant data handling

## Documentation

- [Protocol Specification](protocol-specification.md)
- [Schema Standard](schema-standard.md)
- [Integration Guide](integration-guide.md)
- [AI IPASS Setup](ai-ipass-setup.md)
- [Security Guidelines](security-guidelines.md)

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Protocol Specification](protocol-specification.md)
2. Set up your AI IPASS following the [AI IPASS Setup Guide](ai-ipass-setup.md)
