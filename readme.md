# Autonomous Integration Framework (AIF)

The Autonomous Integration Framework (AIF) is a standardized approach and set of tools for managing AI-generated integration mappings and maintaining a standard for exchanging schemas between systems.


## Key Features

- Central AI Integration Platform as a Service (AI IPASS)
- Standardized schema management
- AI-generated integration mappings
- Automated schema polling and RAG updates
- Vector store for efficient data retrieval
- Secure and compliant data handling
