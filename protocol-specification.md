# AI Integration Protocol Specification

## 1. Overview

The AI Integration Protocol (AIP) defines a standardized approach for managing AI-generated integration mappings and maintaining a standard for exchanging schemas between systems.

## 2. Components

### 2.1 AI IPASS (AI Integration Platform as a Service)

The central hub for managing integrations, schemas, and AI-powered functionalities.

### 2.2 System X Schema Management

Defines how individual systems should manage and expose their schemas.

### 2.3 Integration Protocol

Specifies the standard methods for systems to integrate and communicate.

### 2.4 AI-Generated Integration Mappings

Describes the process of using AI to generate and maintain integration mappings.

### 2.5 Schema Polling and RAG Update Process

Outlines the mechanism for keeping schemas and RAG data up-to-date.

### 2.6 Vector Store Management

Defines the use and management of vector databases for efficient data retrieval.

## 3. Workflow

1. Systems implement the Schema Standard
2. AI IPASS is configured to connect to various systems
3. AI IPASS polls systems for schema updates
4. AI generates integration mappings based on schemas
5. Vector store is updated with new schema information
6. Systems use the Integration Protocol to exchange data
7. AI IPASS facilitates and manages integrations

## 4. Security and Compliance

Refer to the [Security Guidelines](security-guidelines.md) for detailed information on security measures and compliance requirements.
